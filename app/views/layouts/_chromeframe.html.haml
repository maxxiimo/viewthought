      We can support Internet Explorer 6, and have done so many times for our customers over the years and will do so for you if yyou need to support customers still using Internet Explorer 6. For this website we have decided not to support Internet Explorer 6 for the following reasons:
    %ol
      %li
        It's use in the United States has declined to less than .2%:
        %br
        %a{:href => 'http://www.ie6countdown.com/', :title => ''} The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown
      %li
        Microsoft itself will end support, along with Microsoft XP, in less than a year:
        %br
        %a{:href => 'http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx', :title => ''} Windows XP SP3 and Office 2003 Support Ends April 8, 2014
      %li
        It's common practice now to give customers options to upgrade:
        %br
        %a{:href => "http://browsehappy.com/"} Upgrade to a different browser
        %br
        or
        %a{:href => "http://www.google.com/chromeframe/?redirect=true"} activate Google Chrome Frame
        to experience a website.
      %li Finally, by default our users will experience the mobile version of our site when browsing here with Internet Explorer 6, which may not have all the bells and whistles of the regular experience, but it will work.
