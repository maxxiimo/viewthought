      %p La Postita Eco-cabins and Farm needed to boost their bottom line. They planned to accomplish this through improved marketing, increasing agricultural output, and by employing cost cutting measures. They came to ViewThought for help; specifically, to increase their share of the Costa Rican ecotourism market.
      #slidingDiv
        %p La Postita's website was key to their marketing strategy. The old website was built in 2006. With an international customer base and all advertising pointing to LaPostita.com, something new was badly needed. Their goals:
        %ul
          %li Modernize while maintaining the old look and feel
          %li Multilingual content: English, German and Spanish
          %li A responsive mobile experience
          %li A password-protected, role-based content management system
